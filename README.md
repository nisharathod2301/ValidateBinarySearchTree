# ValidateBinarySearchTree
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Input: root = [2,1,3]

Output: true
